# Springboard_Coursework
Coursework/Mini Projects from the Springboard course, Introduction to Data Science

1. Basic Data Manipulation (see folder Data_Manip): 
This project used a toy data set showing product purchases from an electronics store. The point was to practice basic data manipulation learned from the data camp tutorials. 

2. Dealing with Missing Values (see folder Missing_Val): 
This project used the Titanic data set. The point was to practice dealing with missing values, and figuring out what type of value to fill rows in with if needed.


3. Titanic.R project: 
The point of this mini project was to see the chance of surviving the titanic disaster. The information given in Titanic already includes those who survived the sinking, by their age, sex, and passenger class. This was part of a datacamp tutorial, however since the data source is different there had to be a few adjustments made. The data was loaded from a previous project (see other titanic project in folder), and the survived column cleaned up by replacing any NA with 0 (it is assumed that if there is no data it means they did not survive). 

4. CHIS.R project:
The purpose of this tutorial was to learn build on the plotting functions in order to produce a mosaic plot (Merimeko plot). This type of plot is a visual representation of a continency table, which compares two categorical variables. The question is, which groups are over or under represented in the 2009 CHIS adult-repsponse dataset? This is visualized with groups colored according to their pearson residuals from a chi-squared test.

5. Capstone Project:
This is the main project of the course, in which I have chosen to write a program to recommend anime based on how other users rated them. All important files will be found in there, currently including the data wrangling part of the project.
